# {{.Name}}

An event-driven workflow processor built with the [GoCodeAlone/workflow](https://github.com/GoCodeAlone/workflow) engine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+

### Run

```bash
go run . -config workflow.yaml
```

### Architecture

Events flow through a state machine lifecycle:

```
incoming → received → processing → completed
                   ↘             ↗
                     failed
```

Topics:
- `{{.Name}}.incoming` — events enter here
- `{{.Name}}.processing` — events being processed
- `{{.Name}}.completed` — successfully processed events
- `{{.Name}}.errors` — failed events

### Configuration

Edit `workflow.yaml` to customize topics, state transitions, and handlers.

### Build

```bash
go build -o {{.Name}} .
./{{.Name}} -config workflow.yaml
```
