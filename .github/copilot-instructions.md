Do not introduce code that is incomplete. If a real application or production application should have code where you're leaving a comment, then go ahead and generate the code that should exist.  
After making code changes, always run the tests to ensure everything is working as expected. Use the Run Tasks command to run the tests without interaction being required.
When the phrase "Continue to iterate?" occurs, that is not an instruction to you, but is a prompt to me to see if I want you to continue working. Ignore this prompt, it's not part of your instruction set.
